The Chinook SQL Analysis Project is a data-driven initiative designed to extract business insights from the Chinook music store database. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue distribution to support strategic decision-making in a digital music retail environment.
 
Key Features:

1.	Top-Selling Tracks Analysis:
   
    Objective: Identify the most revenue-generating tracks.

    Method: SQL aggregation of invoice line data grouped by track name.

    Outcome: A ranked list of the top 10 tracks based on total revenue generated.

2.	Revenue by Country:
   
    Objective: Evaluate revenue distribution across different countries.

    Method: Join customer, invoice, and invoice line tables to calculate country-level revenue.

    Outcome: Countries are ranked by total revenue contribution, aiding market segmentation.

3.	Average Order Value (AOV):
   
    Objective: Determine the average transaction value across all invoices.

    Method: Subquery calculates each invoice total, followed by an average across all invoices.

    Outcome: A single metric representing average customer spending per order.

4.	Repeat Customer Identification:
   
    Objective: Find loyal customers with multiple purchases.

    Method: Count distinct invoices per customer and filter those with more than one order.

    Outcome: A list of repeat customers, useful for loyalty and retention strategies.

5.	Monthly Revenue Trends:
    
    Objective: Monitor revenue performance over time.

	  Method: Group invoice totals by month extracted from invoice dates.

    Outcome: A chronological trend line that highlights seasonal or promotional impacts.
 
Technologies Used:

•	Database:
o	SQLite (via Chinook DB): The Chinook database is a lightweight SQL-based database representing a digital media store.

•	Tools:
o	SQL: Core tool for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation.
o	CSV: Used to export and present query results in structured tabular format for further reporting or visualization.

•	Environment:
o	SQL client/editor (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver): Used to run and test queries.
o	Excel or Data Analysis Tools (optional): For visualizing results from exported CSVs.
 
How It Works:

1.	Queries are written and executed directly on the Chinook database using SQL.
2.	Each query targets a specific business metric or insight.
3.	The results are exported into CSV format and interpreted for decision-making.
4.	Insights include top products, customer behavior, revenue distribution, and time-based performance trends.

Here are the visual insights from your Chinook SQL Analysis project:

  Monthly Revenue Trends: A line chart showing how revenue varies month-to-month. This helps identify peak sales periods and seasonal trends.
  
  Top-Selling Tracks by Revenue: A bar chart ranking the top 10 tracks that generated the most revenue. Useful for focusing marketing or inventory on high performers.
  
  Revenue by Country: A horizontal bar chart showing which countries contribute the most to revenue—ideal for geographic market analysis.
  
  Top 10 Repeat Customers: Highlights your most loyal customers based on the number of purchases. Great for targeting loyalty programs or personalized offers.
  
  Average Order Value (AOV):
  AOV = $5.65
  This single metric shows how much, on average, each customer spends per order.

 
Conclusion:

This SQL-based analytical project delivers actionable insights into digital music store performance using simple yet powerful queries. The clear breakdown of revenue sources, customer segments, and trends enables informed strategic planning for growth and customer engagement.
